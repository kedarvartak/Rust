// By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that
// it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the prelude

// If a type you want to use isnâ€™t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope
// explicitly with a use statement. Using the std::io library provides you with a number
// of useful features, including the ability to accept user input.
